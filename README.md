  - Motion detection to reduce unnecessary recording.
  - AI-based anomaly detection to flag unusual activities.

**Installation Locations:**
- **Living Areas:**
  - Hallways to monitor resident and staff movement.
  - Entry and exit points to ensure the safety of residents.
- **Medical Stations:**
  - Medication storage areas to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Recreational Areas:**
  - Common rooms and outdoor spaces to oversee resident safety.
- **Administrative Offices:**
  - Entry points to track visitor and employee activity.

**Access and Monitoring:**
- **Real-Time Monitoring:**
  - Feeds are observed 24/7 by trained personnel in a secure control room.
  - AI systems send alerts for anomalies, such as unauthorized access or unusual movements.
- **Footage Retention:**
  - Data is stored for 60 days on redundant cloud storage and local backups.

**Maintenance Schedule:**
- **Weekly:** Run diagnostics to detect potential camera failures.
- **Quarterly:** Update firmware and software to address vulnerabilities.

## **2. Specific Continuity Strategies**

### **A. Inventory Management**
**Preemptive Actions:**
- Maintain safety stock levels for critical supplies, such as medications and medical equipment.
- Partner with multiple suppliers to ensure alternative sourcing options.

**Emergency Procedures:**
- Switch to manual inventory logging during system outages.
- Cross-verify manual records with digital systems once restored to maintain data integrity.

---

### **B. Resident Communication**
**Channels:**

## **3. Disaster Recovery Workflows**

### **A. System Recovery and Workarounds**
**Backup Practices:**
- Nightly encrypted backups of all critical data to secure cloud storage and physical media.
- Store physical backups in fireproof, tamper-resistant safes.

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Cross-reference physical and digital backups for completeness.
2. Restore systems in order of criticality, prioritizing resident care platforms.
3. Conduct system tests before resuming operations to ensure functionality.

---

### **B. Physical Infrastructure Recovery**
**Initial Actions:**
- Conduct thorough damage assessments, focusing on resident safety and structural integrity.
- Engage pre-approved contractors for immediate repairs.

**Temporary Solutions:**
- Relocate essential operations to pre-identified alternative sites.
- Use portable storage units to secure critical inventory and equipment.

---

## **4. Training Plans for Employees**

### **A. Security Training**
**Frequency:**
- Held quarterly to ensure up-to-date knowledge and compliance.

**Content:**
- Proper use of surveillance and access control systems.
- Identifying and reporting suspicious activity.

**Delivery Methods:**
- **Workshops:** Hands-on equipment demonstrations.
- **E-Learning Modules:** Interactive digital lessons for remote access.
- **Scenario-Based Exercises:** Simulated scenarios for real-world application.

---

### **B. BCP and DRP Drills**
**Drill Scenarios:**
- Simulated power outages to test generator functionality and manual processes.
- Medical supply discrepancies to practice reconciliation methods.
- Emergency relocation exercises to evaluate team readiness.

**Post-Drill Evaluation:**
- Collect participant feedback through surveys.
- Analyze performance metrics and revise plans accordingly.
